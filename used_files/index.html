        On the following pages you will first be playing a simple pixelgame. <br>
        The goal of the game is to continually select the image which is most appealing to you.<br>
        Don't overthink it, but do try to actually make a choice as opposed to clicking randomly.<br>
        the center image is the image you chose the round before, and is not choosable.<br><br>

        After you are done with this, we ask you to fill in the survey provided.<br>
        The survey contains questions which ask you to describe yourself.<br>
        Results are anonymous, so no need to worry about privicy.<br><br>

        If you have questions about our research, please send an email to PLACEHOLDER afterwards.<br>

        that's all for now, click below to start the pixelgame<br>
        <button onclick="window.location.href='testpixel.html'">Start game!</button>
