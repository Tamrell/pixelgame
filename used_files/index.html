        The goal of the game is to continually select the image which is most appealing to you.
        Don't overthink it, but do try to actually make a choice as opposed to clicking randomly.

        After you are done with this, we ask you to fill in the survey provided.
        The survey contains questions which ask you to describe yourself.
        Results are anonymous, so no need to worry about privicy.

        If you have questions about our research, please send an email to PLACEHOLDER afterwards.

        that's all for now, click below to start the pixelgame
